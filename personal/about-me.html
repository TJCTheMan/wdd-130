            <p>My name is Tevin Coles, I am 23 years old and I am from Ririe, Idaho. I am a Linux Enthusiast, Content Creator, Gamer/Streamer, and I dabble in programming and Web development. I have been building PC's since I was in high school, I was administrating a rather large modded Minecraft server and accompanying Discord server at the time, and due to my limited amount of ram, was introduced to Ubuntu as a lighter-weight operating system that would allow me to run bigger modpacks better. This is how I got into Linux in the first place.</p>
            <p>Around the time I graduated, I was called to serve a mission for the church in Dallas, Texas. I retured home in October 2019, and shortly thereafter, built the first iteration of the system I run today. That first "real gaming rig" was a ryzen 5 2600, 16GB of DDR4 (quickly upgraded to 32), and an RX580 8GB, all on a ASUS ROG STRIX B450-F Gaming Motherboard. This was also my introduction to Windows 10, as well as Solid-State Drives.</p>
            <p>I ran this system for around a year, but as time went on, things got replaced and upgraded. I now have a much better PC that i am still upgrading and improving, and have been dualbooting Windows and Linux on for about 2 years now. I am now at BYU-I, taking classes for my Major, Computer Engineering. I still admin for a few minecraft servers, I am a content creator with the online handle of TJCTheMan, if you want to know more, there are links and things over at <a href="https://tjctheman.com" title="TJ's Domain">TJCTheMan.com.</a> Thanks for taking some time to read this and I hope to get to know all of you better as time goes on.</p>
